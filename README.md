# Pathology report classification

A pathology report is written using technical medical language by a pathologist to inform the referring doctor about cancer diagnostic and staging information. Aim of pathology report is to disseminate the results from pathologists' inspection back to the physician or surgeon. It consists of information like patients name, gross description, microscopic description, diagnosis, tumor size and margin including the other information divided into three to four sections like medical history, diagnosis, summary and conclusion. For more information about pathology reports read [here](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/pathology-reports-fact-sheet#:~:text=The%20pathologist%20sends%20a%20pathology,explain%20the%20report%20to%20them). However, the pathology reports aren't structured and lack one or the other of the abovementioned sections except the diagnostic information. On top of that, these reports are handwritten notes on a printed template, signed and stored as digital pdf documents. Converting the pdf documents to machine readable text files using optical character recognition tools adds additional noise to these otherwise unstructured reports. We propose an approach to utilize these highly-noisy and unstructured pathology reports to automatically extract information about gleason grading.
